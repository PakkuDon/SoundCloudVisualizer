# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2019-11-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This has been a long-running side project. I am interested in capturing what design decisions have been made, and why.

## Decision

This repo will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
